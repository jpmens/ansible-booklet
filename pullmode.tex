\subsection*{Pull mode}

Instead of pushing configuration from a master to nodes it may be advantageous to pull from the master onto the nodes.
\ansible{} can run a playbook on a node if the node has a full installation of \ansible{} and its dependencies.
The example in Fig.~\ref{ansiblepullmode} shows how to accomplish this using a repository available to all nodes from which they obtain current copies of Playbooks and supporting files. \href{http://jpmens.net/2012/07/14/ansible-pull-instead-of-push/}{Read more}.
